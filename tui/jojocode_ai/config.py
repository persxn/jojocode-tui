"""Runtime configuration for JojoAI.

── Where the model comes from ──────────────────────────────────────────────

The installer looks at the machine, picks a model that will actually fit, and
pulls it. It used to stop there — and the TUI then started with a hard-coded
`gpt-oss:120b` regardless, so a laptop that had just been told "qwen2.5-coder:7b
suits this machine", and had pulled exactly that, opened on a 65 GB model it did
not have and reported it as missing. The recommendation was real work thrown
away at the last step.

So there is now one written-down answer, `settings.json` beside the saved
credentials, and everything reads it. Highest wins:

    --model <tag>            this run only
    JOJO_MODEL=<tag>         this shell
    settings.json "model"    what the installer chose for this machine
    FALLBACK_MODEL           a machine nobody has measured

The same file holds `host`, so a box running Ollama elsewhere is configured
once rather than aliased into every shell.
